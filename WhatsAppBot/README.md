# WhatsAppBot

## Properties.Settings
These need to be manually change in project

- The Chromium version I use is 74.0.3707.0
- Later versions may not work with the included *chromedriver.exe*

- LyricsFolder is just some folder where it stores lyrics that have been downloaded previously

## Notes
- You need to login to WhatsApp every time. Ideally, it should store the browser state/cookies? so it thinks its the same browser.
